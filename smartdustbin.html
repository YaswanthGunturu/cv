 IDEA:<br> The basic idea was to reduce the  AIR POLLUTION caused by the excess waste in the dustbins.<br> The idea implemented here is , daily we see street dust bins are filled with garbage and it even fall on the roads and in rainy season this problem increases. So to overcome this we made the dustbins travel automatically  to the garbage decomposing area when it is filled to a certain area.
