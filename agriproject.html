  <p>IDEA : <br>Rice is a crop which needs high amount of water for its growth.<br> The main factor to be considered here is that the water should not be too low. <br>Periodic monitoring and controlling water level is essential for the healthy growth of the rice plant.<br> The initial activities like ploughing, seeding etc. and the final activities like harvesting are done as a group and hence can be easily coordinated. <br>The periodic monitoring of needs, controlling and the pests and water level monitoring is a tedious process. <br>Since the pumping of water to and from the field is the major activity from ploughing to harvesting. Automating the process can be greatly reduced the load on farmers. Automated systems may monitor the water level and regulated the levels by sophisticated systems and can send messages to the farmers</p>
